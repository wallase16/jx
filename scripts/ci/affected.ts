/**
 * Decides which CI jobs a pull request can actually fail, and emits that decision as GitHub Actions
 * job outputs. Consumed by the `changes` job in .github/workflows/test.yml.
 *
 * The rule this implements: a check runs when its inputs changed, and not otherwise. The rule it
 * does NOT implement: gating everything. Measured on green run 31489926926, lint is 1s, both
 * typechecks are 5s, and all four docs gates together are 3s — while a fresh job costs ~15s to
 * provision. Gating those would make CI slower. Only three things here are worth a gate: the
 * per-workspace test matrix (0.3-5.3 min each), `check-lens-mutants` (87s), and the bundle builds
 * (20s each). Everything else stays unconditional in the `checks` job.
 *
 * Correctness before economy. Three properties matter more than any minute saved:
 *
 * 1. The matrix is DERIVED from disk. The hand-maintained 18-entry list it replaces had no guard at
 *    all: add a package, forget to list it, and it is never tested.
 * 2. `package.json` is not the whole graph. Several suites reach across workspaces at the filesystem
 *    level and are invisible to a dependency reader — see EXTRA_EDGES, where each one carries the
 *    test file that proves it, asserted to exist on startup.
 * 3. Unknown paths FAIL OPEN. A changed file matching no rule turns everything on rather than quietly
 *    narrowing the run. New top-level directories therefore cost a full run, once, until someone
 *    classifies them — which is the right direction to be wrong in.
 *
 * In CI it derives the diff from the merge base with the base branch. To see what a working diff
 * would trigger, pipe one in:
 *
 *     git diff --name-only origin/main... | bun scripts/ci/affected.ts --stdin
