/**
 * Check-shot-contract.ts — Lane 1 of the screenshot gate (UX-REDESIGN-PLAN §13.5).
 *
 * `docs:verify` does not verify screenshots. `scripts/docs/check-doc-refs.ts:209-231` asserts only
 * that a referenced image resolves into `docs/images/`, that its basename is a name the manifest
 * COULD produce, and `existsSync`. No CI job runs `bun run screenshots`. So a panel rename ships
 * wrong pictures under green CI, which is exactly how two shots stayed red on main for weeks.
 *
 * This check closes that half in seconds, with no browser: it reads `scripts/screenshots/
 * manifest.json` and the command projection, and fails NAMING BOTH SIDES OF THE BREAK —
 *
 *     manifest shot "properties-bar" step 3 names command "view.setActivity" with tab "head";
 *     the panel registry declares "page"
 *
 * — in the PR that caused it, so the renamer sees it rather than an archaeologist three weeks
 * later. It enforces the two rules §13 establishes:
 *
 * R1. A shot may name inputs the app accepts, never values the app derives. R2. The pipeline may
 * only ask the app to do sooner what the plan already commits to.
 *
 * Rules, in the order they fire:
 *
 * 1. Every command step names a declared, scriptable command, and every seed step names a declared
 *    seed. The projection is the app's registry ∪
 *    {@link import("../packages/studio/src/services/automation").seedIds} ∪ the shrinking
 *    `AUTOMATION_COMMANDS` gap list.
 * 2. No command id matches `/\.toggle[A-Z]/` — §13.3 clause 3. A toggle is a delta against unstated
 *    state, which is what silently inverted 18 steps when the assistant's default flipped.
 *    {@link TOGGLE_DEBT} is **empty**, so any toggle id is a hard error the first time it appears.
 * 3. `args` validate against the command's own `args` JSON Schema, where one is declared.
 * 4. No CSS or XPath selector anywhere in the manifest, and no hand-stamped (non-derived) region id
 *    beyond the committed count — the `ALLOWED_ORPHANS` idiom from
 *    `packages/studio/scripts/check-styles.ts`. The selector counters are all at **zero**.
 * 5. The `input`-step and `unstable` counts §13.3 caps, same shape.
 * 6. `manifest.contract` matches {@link CONTRACT_VERSION}.
 *
 * **Quarantined shots are read past.** A shot carrying `status: {state: "quarantined"}` is one the
 * repo admits is broken; the runner skips it too, `docs:check` fails if a page still illustrates
 * itself with it, and its ids are checked again the moment the quarantine is lifted — which is the
 * moment someone is looking. Holding a disabled shot to the contract only means fixing it twice.
 *
 * The manifest is read in BOTH shapes: contract 0 (`actions`/`waitFor`/`regions`/`variants`, which
 * only the fixtures under `scripts/screenshots/fixtures/contract/` still use) and contract 1
 * (`steps`/`expect`/`capture`), so the fixtures that prove each rule need not be rewritten with
 * it.
 *
 * **One gate, two manifests.** `scripts/videos/manifest.json` (`scripts/videos/PLAN.md`, Phase 3)
 * is walked by the SAME reader: a walkthrough's `cues[].steps` are exactly a shot's `steps`, so
 * `readManifest` folds `root.walkthroughs[]` in alongside `root.shots[]` rather than growing a
 * second definition of "a valid id". Its counts are held to their own budget
 * ({@link WALKTHROUGH_BUDGET}), never {@link CONTRACT_BUDGET} — the screenshot manifest's ratchet
 * has 300+ shots of history behind its numbers, and folding a three-cue walkthrough into them would
 * make an unrelated file move a budget it did not earn. With no `--manifest` flag, `main()` checks
 * both files in one run; `--manifest` (fixtures, tests) checks exactly the one named.
 *
 * Run in the CI `checks` job: `bun scripts/check-shot-contract.ts` Against fixtures: `bun
 * scripts/check-shot-contract.ts --manifest <m.json> --commands <mod.ts>`

/**
 * The counts §13.3 caps, committed at what the CONVERTED manifest holds.
 *
 * The check fails when a count goes UP — that is the whole contract. When a count goes down the run
 * prints a ratchet line naming the new value; lowering the committed number is then a one-line
 * edit, and raising one needs the same written justification as lowering a coverage threshold
 * (CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * - `selectorActions` `click`/`hover`/`type`/`canvasClick`/`dispatchDragOver` with a selector. **0**
 *   — the contract has no verb that takes one.
 * - `waitForSelectors` `waitFor: {type: "selector"}` steps. **0** — all 43 became `expect`.
 * - `regionSelectors` region captures addressed by CSS instead of a region id. **0**.
 * - `clipSelectors` `clip: {selector}`. **0** — `of: "viewport"` names the camera's own frame.
 * - `argSelectors` a puppeteer handler prefix (`xpath/`, `pierce/`) inside a step's `args`. Always
 *   zero, and landing it at zero is what keeps it zero.
 * - `inputSteps` raw input: keystrokes, typing, caret placement, synthetic drags. §13.6 wanted ≤6. It
 *   lands at **14**, and the gap is almost entirely the two ids that have no command record yet
 *   (`element.insertData`, `media.browse`) plus `tab-strip-shot`, which types into a real editor
 *   because the dirty flag is EARNED, not asserted. Each falls out as its record lands.
 *
 *   **14 → 13 when "resolving with" became a popover.** `counter-test-prop` typed into
 *   `pane.primary/prop:count`, which a popover puts behind a gesture — so the value got a record
 *   (`canvas.setTestProp`) and the shot names it. The change that could have cost a step paid one
 *   back, because the fields moving out of reach is exactly what forced the capability to be named.
 *
 *   **19 → 14 in P6.2**, the ratchet moving the way it is meant to: `settings.selectEntry` was the
 *   five of them, and it did not become a record of its own — `settings.open` grew an `entry`
 *   argument, because a map-layout section's entry is a KEY in that section and naming it is naming
 *   state. Not one `settings.open {section}` step changed.
 *
 *   **18 → 19 in P5, and it is the one direction this file says a number may not move**, so here is
 *   the justification the rule asks for. A quarantined shot's steps are not counted (they are read
 *   past, below), so `block-action-bar-shot` being broken since 6604ede8 is what took this to 18 —
 *   the count fell because a shot STOPPED WORKING. P5 fixed what broke it (`probe.revealPath` was
 *   inert on the Edit surface: it panned `view.panY`, which only reaches the screen through a panzoom
 *   transform Edit does not render), and lifting the quarantine hands its one `caret` step back. No
 *   step was added, and the number of shots the app can actually be driven through went up. This is
 *   the only way this budget may rise: a step returning from quarantine, named.
 *
 *   **13 → 14, and it is the same way and the same reason.** `slash-menu-shot` came back from
 *   quarantine, handing its one `caret` step back. It went in because a synthetic "/" opened nothing,
 *   and the diagnosis in its `status` was too kind to the app: the menu had NO working trigger at
 *   all, in a browser or out of one. `editor/inline-edit.ts` recognised the keystroke in a listener
 *   bound to the BLOCK, while the editing host is the canvas container — so the listener never fired,
 *   for anyone. The gesture is fixed at the host, and the shot's two `type` steps became ONE command
 *   step (`insert.openSlashMenu`), which is the conversion this file exists to ask for: the step now
 *   names an input the app accepts by name. Net input steps for the shot: three to one. The budget
 *   rises by the one `caret` step quarantine was hiding.
 * - `nonDerivedRegions` DISTINCT region ids no registry stamps for free — the hand-stamped leaves
 *   §13.3 budgets for (`navigator/panel:git/commit`, `navigator/statements`, the settings entry
 *   rows…). Contract 0 counted 17 CSS selectors here.
 *
 *   **11 → 10 when "resolving with" became a popover**, and `pane.primary/prop:count` is the one that
 *   left: a test value is set by `canvas.setTestProp` now, so no shot addresses the field.
 *
 *   **12 → 11 with the second pane**, and the media-picker's browse button is the one that left. It
 *   was hand-stamped `inspector/field:<prop>/browse`, and the stamp was a claim about location the
 *   picker cannot make: the Document Header card draws the same control inside every pane's STAGE, so
 *   with two panes the id resolved to two elements and `resolveRegion` answered with the side pane's
 *   — an `inspector/…` id on a control that is not in the Inspector. `ui/regions.ts` derives it now,
 *   scoped to the one Inspector, and the number falls the way this file says a number should: because
 *   a hand-stamp became unnecessary.
 * - `unstable` `{reason, until}` escape hatches. **2** after P6.2 retired the five `settings.
 *   selectEntry` steps. Of what is left, one is `blog-insert-data`'s, whose id LANDED in P5
 *   (`insert.data`) and whose step survives because the shot's subject is the merge-tag LIST, a
 *   control — a docs decision, not a registry gap. See {@link REMEDY}.
