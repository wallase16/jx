# Studio screenshot runner

Declarative, repeatable screenshots of Jx Studio for jxsuite.com, READMEs, and docs. Shots are
defined in [manifest.json](./manifest.json); the runner boots (or reuses) the repo dev server,
drives Studio in headless Chromium via the gated `window.__jxAutomation` hook
([packages/studio/src/services/automation.ts](../../packages/studio/src/services/automation.ts)),
and writes PNGs to `sites/jxsuite.com/public/screenshots/` — where the site's Sharp/srcset image
pipeline and the root README consume them.

Shots drive the **starter sites** (`packages/starters/sites/*`) so the docs and marketing show real
sample projects, not Jx's own internals. `real-estate` is the default (Manage / Script / State /
Git — its `re-listings-filter` has an editable `visibleCount` function for the "Script" shot). The
content-rendering shots pick the most colorful fit: **Edit** renders the `restaurant` homepage
(edit/preview modes run the page, so content resolves), and **Design** styles the `event` site's
violet `ev-savedate` component (design mode shows the un-run template, so it emphasizes the
breakpoint canvas + CSS inspector rather than resolved text).

## Usage

```bash
bun run screenshots                 # regenerate, keeping visually-identical shots byte-for-byte
bun run screenshots --only hero     # one shot (comma-separate for several)
bun run screenshots --headed        # visible browser + 15s linger, for tuning
bun run screenshots --force         # overwrite every shot, skipping the visual-diff check
bun run screenshots --manifest x.json
CHROMIUM_BIN=/path/to/chromium bun run screenshots   # explicit browser binary
```

Requires a system Chromium/Chrome (`CHROMIUM_BIN`, else `chromium`/`google-chrome`/… on PATH).
No browser is downloaded — this is what makes the runner work on NixOS and plain CI alike.

## Change detection

Screenshots are **committed to git**, so re-running shouldn't churn them. Before overwriting a shot,
the runner captures to a buffer and compares it to the committed PNG with a tolerant **visual diff**
— both are decoded and downscaled to a 32×32 thumbnail in the (already-running) browser and compared
as mean per-channel difference; a shot whose diff is ≤ 1% keeps its old bytes (logged `— kept`),
anything larger is rewritten (logged `updated (Δ…%)`). Same-machine re-renders are deterministic
(the freeze/srgb/hinting measures below make them byte-identical → `Δ0.00%`), so a no-op run leaves
`git status` clean; only shots that actually changed are touched. `--force` skips the check.

Two caveats carry over: **regenerate wholesale from one machine** when Studio's UI changes (a
different machine's font rasterization diffs past the threshold and rewrites everything), and the
`git-panel` shot reflects the repo's live Source Control state, so it legitimately updates whenever
your working tree differs.

## Shot schema

Each shot opens `?project=<abs>/project.json&file=<rel>&automation=1` (Studio's own deep-link
support), waits for the canvas iframe to ack `renderComplete`, then applies actions:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "hero", // output file name (hero.png)
  "project": "packages/starters/sites/real-estate", // repo-relative project dir (default from `defaults`)
  "file": "pages/index.md", // file to open in a tab
  "canvasMode": "design", // design | edit | preview | stylebook
  "viewport": { "width": 1920, "height": 1200 },
  "deviceScaleFactor": 2, // 2 → 3840×2400 PNG
  "theme": "dark", // flips <sp-theme color>
  "actions": [
    { "do": "setActivity", "value": "layers" }, // files|layers|imports|blocks|state|data|head|git
    { "do": "select", "path": ["children", 0] }, // select a node by JxPath
    { "do": "setRightTab", "value": "style" }, // properties|events|style
    { "do": "editDef", "defName": "addItem" }, // open Monaco on a state function
    { "do": "openBrowse" }, // open the Manage Files modal
    { "do": "setZoom", "value": 0.9 },
    { "do": "setStatus", "value": "Ready" }, // normalize the status bar text
  ],
  "waitFor": [
    // runs AFTER actions (baseline readiness is built in)
    { "type": "canvasReady" },
    { "type": "selector", "selector": ".monaco-editor .view-lines" },
    { "type": "fonts" },
    { "type": "settle", "frames": 2 },
  ],
  "clip": { "selector": "#app" }, // "#app" full window | "fullPage" | {x,y,width,height} | "none"
  "regions": [
    // Extra cropped captures from the SAME boot — each emits <name>.png. Great for tight
    // shots of individual control surfaces (a panel, an inspector section, a toolbar).
    { "name": "git-commit", "selector": ".git-commit-area", "padding": 16 },
  ],
  "variants": [{ "suffix": ".light", "theme": "light" }],
}
```

## Partial / region captures

A shot's `clip` controls the primary `<name>.png`:

- `{ "selector": "#app" }` — the studio window (default)
- `"fullPage"` — the whole scrollable page
- `{ "x", "y", "width", "height" }` — an explicit rect in CSS px
- `"none"` — skip the primary capture entirely (use with `regions` for a region-only shot)

`regions` adds any number of extra crops from the same Studio boot — one Studio launch, drive the
state once, emit several tightly-cropped PNGs. Each region is `{ name, selector, padding? }`:
`name` is the output basename (unique across the whole manifest, like a shot name), `selector`
resolves in the main frame (Studio panels are light DOM, so `.git-panel`, `.signals-panel`,
`#right-panel`, `.new-project-modal`, etc. all work), and `padding` (CSS px, default 0) adds
breathing room. The runner scrolls the element into view, measures its box, pads it, and clamps to
the page before clipping. Region-only shot:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "control-surfaces",
  "file": "components/todo-app.json",
  "canvasMode": "design",
  "actions": [{ "do": "setActivity", "value": "git" }],
  "clip": "none",
  "regions": [
    { "name": "git-commit", "selector": ".git-commit-area", "padding": 16 },
    { "name": "git-branch", "selector": ".git-branch-row", "padding": 8 },
  ],
}
```

Determinism measures: animations/transitions/carets frozen via injected CSS in every frame,
`prefers-reduced-motion` emulated, `document.fonts.ready` awaited in parent + canvas frames,
`--force-color-profile=srgb --font-render-hinting=none`.

## Authoring tips

- Markdown pages show inline-edit placeholders in **design** mode — use `preview` for clean
  content shots, or a `.json` page for design-mode shots with selections.
- The design canvas lays breakpoint panels side by side; `setZoom` controls how much fits.
- `--headed` keeps each page open 15s so you can inspect what the shot definition produced.
