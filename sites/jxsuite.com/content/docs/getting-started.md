# Your first project

In about ten minutes you'll create a site in Jx Studio, design a page, add a bit of interactivity, and publish it to git — all without hand-writing a line of JSON. (If you _do_ want to see the underlying format, every page here has a counterpart under **Format & Reference**.)

## 1. Get Studio

Download the desktop app for [macOS, Windows, or Linux](/docs/get-studio), or install the CLI and run Studio locally:

```bash
bun create @jxsuite my-site
cd my-site && bun run dev
```

There's no hosted Studio to sign into — it runs on your machine, against your files. Full details on both paths are in **[Get Studio](/docs/get-studio)**.

## 2. Create a project

In Studio, choose **New Project**. Give it a name and a folder, set your production URL, and pick a **deployment adapter** — Static, Cloudflare, Node, or Bun.

Then pick a **template**. Start from **Blank** for an empty project, or clone one of the [starter sites](/templates) — a restaurant, shop, portfolio, SaaS landing, blog, and more. Each one is a complete, themed site (pages, components, content, and images) you can reshape into your own. Studio copies it in as plain files and opens it on the canvas.

Prefer the terminal? The CLI takes the same templates:

```bash
bun create @jxsuite my-site --template restaurant
```

Already have a Jx project? Use **Open Project** to point Studio at a folder on disk, or **Clone** to pull one from git.

## 3. Manage, edit, design

Studio gives you a surface for each part of the job. Start in **[Manage](/docs/manage)** to see your project — pages, components, content, and media — with live previews.

Open a content page and switch to **[Edit](/docs/edit)** to write inline — click any text and type, use slash commands for blocks, fill in frontmatter on the side. Open a component and switch to **[Design](/docs/design)** for the visual canvas: a live preview at every breakpoint, and a full CSS inspector for spacing, type, color, and hover states.

## 4. Add an interaction

Websites do things. In Studio, interactivity comes from three panels working together — no separate "code mode" required:

- **State** — declare a value or a computed one (a counter, a total, a fetched list).
- **Events** — bind a handler to a click, input, or submit with the structured expression editor.
- **Code** — drop into the Monaco editor when a handler needs real JavaScript.

Add a `count` to state, a button, and an `onclick` that increments it — you've built a reactive component. See **[Script & logic](/docs/logic)** for the full toolkit.

## 5. Commit and publish

When you're happy, open **Source Control**. Review your changes, write a message, and **commit and sync** — or, for a brand-new project, **Publish to GitHub** and Studio creates the repository for you.

Here's the one boundary worth knowing: **Studio publishes code; it doesn't build or deploy the site.** It commits and pushes, and it sets the deploy adapter you chose in step 2. Your host takes it from there — building the static site (`bunx jx build`) on every push and serving the `dist/` output from a CDN. See **[Git & publish](/docs/git-publish)** for the full flow.
