# Manage

Manage is your project's home base — the file layer and the CMS layer in one place. Open it from the toolbar to see everything your site is made of, with live previews.

## Browse your project

The Manage modal groups everything by kind — **Pages**, **Layouts**, **Components**, **Content**, and **Media** — with a live preview of each page and component and a thumbnail for every asset. Filter and search to jump to a file, and switch between grid and table views.

Right-click any file to **open**, **rename**, **duplicate**, or **delete** it.

## Create pages and content

Use **New** to add a Page, Layout, or Component. Studio also lists an entry for each **content type** your project defines, so creating a blog post or a doc is one click — Studio pre-fills the frontmatter from that type's schema.

## Upload media

Drag images, video, audio, PDFs, or fonts into Manage and Studio writes them to your project's `public/` folder, ready to reference. The site build optimizes images automatically (responsive `srcset`, WebP/AVIF).

## Model your content

Content types are your CMS schema. Studio's content-type builder lets you define a collection — its source folder, format, and a field schema — visually. Behind the scenes this is the `contentTypes` block in your `project.json`; see **[Site architecture](/docs/site-architecture)** for the underlying shape.
