/**
 * `scripts/screenshots/lib/drive.ts` mirrors `src/ui/regions.ts` BY HAND.
 *
 * It has to: `page.evaluate` ships a function's own source into the browser and cannot carry its
 * imports, so the shot runner carries a second copy of region resolution. Its docstring says "the
 * app remains the authority, and an id that only this copy would resolve is a bug in this copy" —
 * and then the inverse happened. A derived resolver for `inspector/field:<prop>/browse` was added
 * to the app, the mirror never got it, and because `(.+)` is greedy the mirror's bare-field rule
 * claimed `image/browse` as a prop of that name and answered nothing. One shot went red, and the
 * only reason it was noticed is that the shot lane happened to run.
 *
 * A docstring is not a guard. This is: both implementations resolve the same corpus of ids against
 * the same DOM, and must agree element-for-element.
