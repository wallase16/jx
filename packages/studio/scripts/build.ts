/**
 * Build.ts — bundle the studio app with build-time metadata injected.
 *
 * The browser bundle can't read package.json at runtime, so version/build info is injected as
 * compile-time constants (consumed by src/version.ts). After the main bundle, the Monaco web
 * workers are built via build-workers.ts. Desktop's pre-build shells out to `bun run build`, so
 * this injection covers both the dev-server and desktop targets.
