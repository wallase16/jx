# AI Assistant — Architecture Decision Record

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-13)
**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Decision owner:** Gideon
**Supersedes the network/UX assumptions in:** `docs/ai-assistant-plan.md`, `specs/ai-assistant.md`

> **Ported 2026-07-09** from the local `feat/ai-assistant-stack-b-v2` branch (Phase 1 of
> `docs/assistant-sdk-perception-plan.md`) — a historical decision record, kept as-written.
> Some file paths below predate the TS port (`.js` where the tree now has `.ts`); the
> decisions and rationale still hold. Current status: `specs/ai-assistant.md` is the living
> spec this ADR fed into.

## 1. Why this doc exists

Two **independent** AI assistant implementations currently coexist in the tree. They were
built against different assumptions and do not agree on provider, mutation model, UI library,
or transport. Before writing more code we need to pick one canonical direction so the two
stop diverging.

This ADR records the conflict, the trade-offs, the decision, and the locked-in UX choices.

## 2. The two stacks

### Stack A — Claude Agent SDK (shipped, platform-abstracted)

| Aspect         | Detail                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI             | `packages/studio/src/panels/ai-panel.ts` — right-panel tab, **QuikChat** (vanilla, not React), `EventSource` SSE |
| Backend        | `packages/server/src/claude-session.ts` (`streamSession`), desktop `packages/desktop/src/ai.ts` `handleAiRoute`  |
| Transport      | `plat.aiStreamUrl(id)` — **routed through `getPlatform()`**, implemented for HTTP server _and_ Electrobun RPC    |
| Provider       | Anthropic Claude via Agent SDK                                                                                   |
| Mutation model | **File-level** — edits files on disk like Claude Code; not `.jx`-AST aware                                       |
| Loop           | **Native agentic loop** (plan → act → observe → repeat)                                                          |
| Undo/redo      | None integrated — writes files directly, bypasses `transactDoc()`                                                |
| Desktop-safe?  | ✅ yes — abstraction implemented in both shells                                                                  |

### Stack B — OpenAI tool-calling (the plan/spec, partially built)

| Aspect         | Detail                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| UI             | `specs/ai-assistant.md` calls for lit-html + Spectrum chat built from scratch (`chat-messages`, `chat-composer`) — **not yet built** |
| Infra          | `packages/ai/` — `chat-state.js`, `streaming-client.js`, `tools.js` (registry only, **no concrete tools**)                           |
| Backend        | `packages/server/src/ai-api.js` — SSE proxy at `/__studio/ai/chat` (built + tested)                                                  |
| Transport      | Raw `fetch('/__studio/ai/chat')` — **NOT in `StudioPlatform`**                                                                       |
| Provider       | OpenAI (GPT-4o/4.1); Anthropic client stubbed                                                                                        |
| Mutation model | **AST-level** — manipulates the in-memory `.jx` document via `transactDoc()`                                                         |
| Loop           | Specced (error-correction, cap 5 rounds, §10.2) — **orchestrator not built** (`tool-executor.js`, `context-manager.js` absent)       |
| Undo/redo      | ✅ free via `transactDoc()`                                                                                                          |
| Desktop-safe?  | ❌ no — proxy is HTTP-only; breaks in the Electrobun packaged build (webview → backend over RPC, no HTTP origin)                     |

---

## 3. The decision dimensions

1. **Product fit.** A layout builder needs _structured, reversible, canvas-visible_ edits to the
   `.jx` document. Stack B's `transactDoc()` AST model is the right abstraction; Stack A's
   file-level edits are a generic coding agent bolted into a panel.
2. **Undo/redo + optimistic apply.** This is a `transactDoc()` concept. Only Stack B can deliver
   the "auto-apply, then undo/redo" UX (see §5). Stack A writes files and has no Studio history hook.
3. **Desktop portability.** Studio ships as a desktop app (`packages/desktop`, Electrobun, MSIX
   release scripts). Anything not routed through `getPlatform()` works in web/dev/NixOS but **breaks
   in the packaged build**. Stack A already solves this; Stack B does not yet.
4. **Loop / self-improvement.** Stack A loops for free. Stack B's loop is designed but unbuilt.
5. **Sunk cost.** Stack B's proxy, infra package, and system prompt are built/tested. Stack A's
   panel mount, SSE plumbing, and platform abstraction are built and shipping.

---

## 4. Decision

**Adopt Stack B (OpenAI tool-calling on the `.jx` AST via `transactDoc()`) as the canonical
assistant**, because it is the only path that delivers structured, reversible, canvas-visible
edits with undo/redo.

**Port three things from Stack A instead of rebuilding them:**

1. **The `getPlatform()` backend abstraction.** Add an AI method to the `StudioPlatform` interface
   and implement it in both desktop platforms (`packages/desktop/src/platform.ts` via RPC and
   `chromium/platform.ts`). This is the fix that makes Stack B desktop-safe. Without it, Stack B
   is a web-only demo.
2. **The existing right-panel mount.** Keep `ai-panel.ts` as the mount point — do not build a new
   sidebar. The chat already lives where it should.
3. **(MVP shortcut) QuikChat as the chat renderer.** It is already integrated and is vanilla JS
   (not React), so it does not violate the "no React" constraint. Building lit-html chat from
   scratch (spec §11.3) is deferred — it buys polish, not capability.

**Keep Stack A alive as an optional "file/dev agent" mode**, not the default. It is genuinely useful
for repo-level operations the document assistant can't do. Do not delete shipped, working code; gate
it behind a mode toggle.

### What this means concretely

- Canonical assistant = `@jxsuite/ai` + `ai-api.js` + AST tools, mounted in the right panel.
- First real work: define the **concrete tools** (the registry is empty) + the **loop orchestrator**.
- Required, non-negotiable: the platform abstraction, or it won't ship on desktop.

---

## 5. Locked UX decision — optimistic apply + undo/redo

**Chosen:** AI changes **auto-apply to the live canvas immediately** via `transactDoc()`. If the user
dislikes the result, **undo/redo** (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y, plus an in-chat Undo button) rolls it back through
Studio's native history.

**Rejected for MVP:** the batched canvas-diff "Accept/Reject" preview gate from `specs/ai-assistant.md`
§8. It is a large state-synchronization effort and adds friction. The spec's §8 should be updated to
reflect this.

**Why this works:** every AI mutation is one `transactDoc()` transaction, so undo/redo is free and
each AI edit is a discrete, reversible step in the same history stack as manual edits. Optimistic apply
also means the agent loop (§6) can _see_ the applied result on the next round.

---

## 6. Looping & self-improvement — status and plan

The user asked: _does our plan allow looping / self-improvement?_ Two different capabilities:

### 6a. Error-correction loop (MVP, in spec, NOT yet built)

Spec §10.2: a failed tool call returns `{success:false, error}`, fed back as a `tool` message; the
LLM retries, capped at **5 rounds**. Primitives exist (`appendToolResult`, `retryLast`); the **driver
that re-calls `streamChat()` after tool results does not exist**. This orchestrator
(`tool-executor.js` / `context-manager.js` in spec §11.2) is the first thing to build in Stack B.
Loop shape: `stream → collect tool calls → execute via transactDoc → append results/errors → re-stream
until no tool calls or cap hit`.

### 6b. Schema-validation eval signal (MVP — sourced from jx-harness)

The strongest near-term eval signal already exists in-process: `validateDocument(doc)` in
`packages/schema/src/schema.ts` returns `{ valid, errors }` via ajv against the same `schema.json`
the compiler uses. The standalone **`jx-harness`** project (`/home/gideon/Dev/jx-harness`) proves the
pattern — its `jx-validate.js` runs exactly this schema validation for external coding agents.

Wire `validateDocument` into the loop (6a): after each mutation, validate the affected subtree and
feed any ajv errors back as the tool result. This upgrades self-correction from "did the tool throw"
to "is the result schema-valid" — catching hyphen-less tagNames, string-vs-object styles, IDL-vs-
attribute mistakes, etc. Deterministic, cheap, and available now. **Validate the edited subtree (or
diff errors), not the whole document** — whole-doc validation surfaces pre-existing errors unrelated
to the AI's edit and is slower.

Two upstream cleanups this surfaces: `jx-harness` carries a runtime patch for a "PropsObject oneOf
overlap" bug in `schema.json` — fix it in `@jxsuite/schema` rather than duplicate the patch; and the
harness hardcodes a local repo path + `opensrc`, which should become a dependency on the published
`@jxsuite/schema`.

### 6c. Shadow-render critic (true Phase 2)

The remaining gap is _runtime_ errors schema validation can't catch (bad bindings, render-time
exceptions). The original `ai-assistant-plan.md` shadow-render + error-boundary idea covers this:
apply the change to an off-screen runtime instance, capture render errors, feed them back. Deferred to
Phase 2 — 6b covers most failure modes first.

**Summary:** the plan _allows_ looping (error-correction, capped). MVP wires the existing
`validateDocument` schema check into the loop (6b, shared with jx-harness); the shadow-render critic
(6c) is true Phase 2. Stack A already loops natively, one reason to keep it as a fallback agent mode.

### 6d. Shared core with jx-harness (open-source alignment)

`jx-harness` and the Studio assistant have the same core needs — authoring rules, schema validator,
golden examples. Keep them from diverging:

- **Validator:** both consume `@jxsuite/schema`'s `validateDocument` (Studio in-process; harness via
  the published package instead of a local path).
- **Rules:** `ai-system-prompt.js` should source its ruleset from the same canonical text as the
  harness `jx-rules.md` / `agent-configs/`, not a hand-rolled copy.
- **Examples:** the golden examples (`examples/components/*`, `examples/pages/blog/*`) double as
  few-shot for the system prompt.

---

## 7. Sign-off (resolved 2026-06-13)

- **Stack B is canonical; Stack A is demoted to an optional file/dev-agent mode** (not retired).
- **QuikChat for MVP** — lit-html chat from scratch is deferred.
- **Shadow-render critic (6b) is Phase 2**, not MVP.

---

## 8. Immediate next steps

1. ✅ **Done** — Added `aiChatUrl()` to `StudioPlatform` + all three adapters (devserver,
   Chromium, Electrobun). Electrobun's local AI `Bun.serve()` now also mounts
   `@jxsuite/server/ai-api`'s `handleAiApi` alongside the existing Claude session routes, so the
   Stack B proxy is reachable from every shell. `@jxsuite/server` gained an `./ai-api` export and
   `@jxsuite/studio` now depends on `@jxsuite/ai`.
2. ✅ **Done** — Defined the concrete AST tools (`read_document`, `set_property`, `add_child`,
   `remove_node`) in `packages/studio/src/services/ai-tools.js` (Studio-specific, per spec §11.2),
   built on the existing `mutate*` helpers in `tabs/transact.ts` — not in `packages/ai/src/tools.js`,
   which stays provider-agnostic infra only.
3. ✅ **Done** — Loop orchestrator (6a) — `packages/studio/src/services/tool-executor.js`
   (`runAgentLoop`, cap 5 rounds). Added `beginAssistantTurn` + `pushToolResultMessage` to
   `@jxsuite/ai`'s `chat-state.js` to support multi-round tool feedback.
4. ✅ **Done (from jx-harness)** — Wired schema validation into the tools as the eval signal (6b):
   `services/jx-validate.js` compiles `@jxsuite/schema` once and `services/ai-tools.js`
   `applyAndValidate` validates before/after each mutation, returning only newly-introduced ajv
   errors as a failed tool result so the loop self-corrects. Aligned the system-prompt tool names
   (`read_document`/`set_property`/`add_child`/`remove_node`) and added schema-error guidance.
5. ✅ **Done** — Repointed `ai-panel.ts` at Stack B via `services/document-assistant.js` (uses
   `createProxyStreamingClient` + `plat.aiChatUrl()`), with incremental QuikChat streaming, an
   Assistant/Dev-Agent mode toggle, and the Claude-auth gate scoped to dev-agent mode only.
6. ✅ **Done** — Updated `specs/ai-assistant.md` §8 to the optimistic-apply model (batched diff
   superseded) and the §1 overview to match.

**All six steps complete.** The MVP is implemented end-to-end: request → proxy stream → AST tools
applied optimistically with undo/redo → schema-validated self-correction loop.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **"Complete" = the architecture skeleton is wired and tested, NOT that the assistant is
> feature-complete or bug-free.** The six steps above are done; the canonical stack is settled.
> Remaining work is _finishing the MVP on this skeleton_ — see §11. Do not re-open the
> architecture decision or revive the native-UI plan to address the gaps below.

## 9. Verification (2026-06-13)

- **Integration tests** (`packages/studio/tests/ai-loop.test.js`) drive the real `runAgentLoop` +
  `registerAiTools` + a real in-memory `tab` with a fake streaming client (no LLM): tool call
  mutates the live doc with one undoable transaction; an injected schema error is fed back and the
  model self-corrects; the 5-round cap trips with the right error. `jx-validate-smoke.test.js`
  exercises the **real** `@jxsuite/schema` validator: valid doc → `[]`, malformed `style` →
  `["/style: must be object"]`. 28 tests pass (5 new + 23 `@jxsuite/ai`); lint clean; typecheck at
  pre-existing baseline.
- **Bug caught & fixed by the smoke test:** the generated schema is JSON Schema **draft 2020-12**;
  `jx-validate.js` originally used the default `Ajv` (draft-07), which _throws_ on the 2020
  meta-schema ref — the exact issue jx-harness works around. Fixed to use `ajv/dist/2020.js` and to
  degrade to a no-op (never throw) if compilation fails.
- **Live proxy verified** on the dev server (`bun run dev`, port 3000): `GET /__studio/ai/models`
  returns the model list (`configured:false` with no key); `POST /__studio/ai/chat` returns the
  correct 401 with a key-missing message. The server-side wiring works in the running app.
- **Upstream follow-up:** `@jxsuite/schema`'s own `validateDocument` uses plain `Ajv` too and likely
  has the same draft-2020 latent bug — worth fixing there. Nothing in this feature depends on it.

---

## 10. Running the assistant locally

**Recommended (lightest): the browser/HTML dev path.** Studio is a web app; its default
`createDevServerPlatform()` adapter talks to `@jxsuite/server` over same-origin `/__studio/*`. So:

1. `bun run build:studio` (once, after code changes).
2. `bun run dev` — serves the repo (incl. Studio's built assets) and mounts the AI proxy on `:3000`.
3. Open `http://localhost:3000/packages/studio/index.html` in a normal browser tab.

Verified serving: `/packages/studio/index.html` → 200, `/packages/studio/dist/studio.js` → 200,
`/__studio/ai/models` → 200. This is lighter than the Chromium/Electrobun desktop shells and is the
preferred dev-test loop. (The desktop shells — `bun run desktop:chromium` on NixOS, `bun run desktop`
for Electrobun — remain the packaged paths.)

**API key (gap now closed).** The Assistant tab has a key gate: a `🔑` settings form (panel
`ai-panel.ts` + `services/ai-settings.js`) stores an OpenAI-compatible key in `localStorage` and sends
it as `X-Api-Key`. **Any OpenAI-compatible key/endpoint works** — an optional endpoint field sends
`X-Api-Base-URL` (local LLM, OpenRouter, Azure, Together, …); the proxy forwards to
`{baseUrl}/chat/completions`. The server `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` env vars remain a
fallback when the client sends nothing.

Steps: open the Studio URL above → right panel **Assistant** tab → enter your key (+ optional
endpoint) in the gate → type a request → edits apply to the canvas, Ctrl+Z to undo.

## 11. Remaining MVP work (completed 2026-06-19)

All five §11 gaps are closed. The MVP is now feature-complete on the Stack B skeleton — 11 tools,
live-streaming chat, visible error feedback, token-budget trimming, and localStorage persistence.

### 11.1 Streaming reactivity bug ✅

**Fix:** `packages/ai/src/chat-state.js` — `beginAssistantTurn()` re-reads `_streamingMessage`
through the Vue reactive proxy after `store.messages.push()` so `appendDelta` /
`appendToolCallStart` / `appendToolResult` mutations notify effects (e.g. `watchAssistant` in
`ai-panel.ts`).

**Test:** `packages/ai/tests/core.test.js` — new test "notifies reactive effects on streaming
appendDelta" wires an `effect()` that tracks `messages[last].content`, calls `appendDelta` twice,
and asserts the effect count increments each time. 24/24 tests pass.

### 11.2 Tool coverage ✅

**File:** `packages/studio/src/services/ai-tools.js` — 7 new tools added (11 total):

| Tool               | Description                                                                                       | Mutation helper                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `set_style`        | Set/remove CSS property (camelCase) on a node                                                     | `mutateUpdateStyle`                     |
| `set_text`         | Set `textContent` (convenience alias)                                                             | `mutateUpdateProperty`                  |
| `add_state`        | Add reactive state variable (scalar, typed, computed, function, data source) — **✅ FIXED §14.1** | Direct mutation on `doc.state`          |
| `update_state`     | Update or remove existing state variable — **✅ FIXED §14.1**                                     | Direct mutation, checks existence first |
| `move_node`        | Move node between parents in the document tree                                                    | `mutateMoveNode`                        |
| `create_component` | Write new `.json` component file to disk                                                          | `saveFile()` via `plat.writeFile()`     |
| `create_page`      | Write new `.json` page file to disk                                                               | Same                                    |

All new tools use `applyAndValidate` for schema-validation feedback. `registerAiTools` now accepts
optional `saveFile` callback (threaded from `document-assistant.js`).

**System prompt:** `ai-system-prompt.js` updated to list all 11 tools with one-line descriptions.

### 11.3 Error surfacing ✅

**File:** `packages/studio/src/panels/ai-panel.ts` — `renderAssistantMessage()` parses tool result
messages. Failed results (`{success: false}`) render as `⚠️ error message` in the chat. Successful
results stay hidden (no noise). New helper `tryParseToolResult()` safely parses JSON from message
content.

### 11.4 Context management ✅

**New file:** `packages/studio/src/services/context-manager.js` — `trimContext(chatState, systemPrompt)`:

- Estimates tokens (4 chars ≈ 1 token), caps at 8,000 total (system prompt + messages).
- Drops oldest messages while preserving last 20 + ≥3 user/tool turns.
- Inserts a summary note so the model knows context was truncated.
- Sets `tokenCount` and `contextWarning` on `chatState`.

Wired into `document-assistant.js` → `sendMessage()` — runs before each stream.

### 11.5 Conversation persistence ✅

**File:** `packages/studio/src/services/document-assistant.js`

- `persistChat()`: saves last 50 messages to `localStorage` (`jx-ai-chat-history`) after each
  send and on `newChat()`.
- `restoreChat()`: restores messages on `createDocumentAssistant()` creation.
- Both degrade gracefully on storage-full, corrupt JSON, or missing key.

### 11.6 Deferred (unchanged)

Shadow-render critic (§6c) — remains Phase 2.

**§11 items wired end-to-end, but NOT all correct — see §14 review.** The MVP plumbing is in place
(11 tools, live-streaming chat, schema-validated self-correction loop capped at 5 rounds,
token-budget trimming, localStorage persistence, visible error feedback) with zero architecture
changes — all additive on Stack B. **However, a 2026-06-19 review found one blocker
(`add_state`/`update_state` write to the wrong path) plus requirement deviations. Do not treat §11
as done until §14 must-fix items are closed.**

## 12. Parked work

The native lit-html chat components (`chat-messages.js`, `chat-composer.js`, `chat-tool-call.js`)
written against the superseded plan are **parked, unwired**, on branch `parked/native-chat-ui`.
They are not part of Stack B and must not be wired into `ai-panel.ts` without re-opening §4.3.
Reusable if native chat is ever revisited: the markdown renderer and composer keybindings.

## 13. Backlog — premium component generation (post-MVP workstream)

**Goal:** have the assistant produce industry-standard, "premium" components (Linear/Stripe-grade
layout, spacing, motion), not just structurally-correct ones.

**Not a tools problem.** The existing tools (`set_property` is fully general; `add_child` takes a
complete node) can already express any DOM + any CSS. Premium output is a **knowledge + context**
problem, addressed via the system prompt and examples — no new plumbing.

**Style model (verified 2026-06-18, NOT Tailwind).** Jx uses CSS-custom-property **design tokens**
declared in `project.json` (e.g. `--color-bg-primary`, `--color-accent`, `--radius`, `--font-mono`)
plus **nested style objects** (camelCase CSS props, nested selectors like `table > thead`) that
reference tokens via `var(--token)`. `sites/jxsuite.com/project.json` is a strong reference: a
complete semantic dark design system. The model must generate _with these tokens_, not hard-coded
values, and not Tailwind utility classes (which jx does not render).

**What this workstream entails (in order, after §11 MVP is solid):**

1. **Design-knowledge section in `ai-system-prompt.js`** — spacing/type scales, elevation/shadow,
   motion, and the rule to build with `var(--token)` references + the nested style-object model.
2. **Curated few-shot examples** — high-quality `.jx` components as pattern targets (ADR §6d:
   golden examples double as few-shot). Source from `examples/` and `sites/jxsuite.com/`.
3. **Design-token injection** — feed the active project's `project.json` tokens into context so
   output stays consistent with the project's system.
4. **Quality tuning loop** — generate → eyeball → refine prompt/examples. Iterative, human-in-loop.

**Sequencing / caveats.** Do **not** start this before §11.1 (the refresh bug) is fixed — you can't
tune output quality while results aren't reliably rendering. Aesthetic quality has **no automated
eval**: schema validation (§6b) and shadow-render (§6c) catch correctness, not taste. A visual
critic is genuinely later (Phase 2+).

## 14. Implementation review (2026-06-19)

Review of the uncommitted §11 implementation. Verified by reading the diffs + running the suite
(`packages/ai` 24/24, `studio` ai-loop 5/5 pass; `typecheck` clean apart from a pre-existing `sharp`
error in the compiler, unrelated). **Verified correct:** the §11.1 reactivity fix (with regression
test), §11.3 error surfacing, and the `set_style` / `set_text` / `move_node` / `create_component` /
`create_page` tools (schema-validated; `saveFile` correctly bound to the real `platform.writeFile`).

### 14.1 ✅ Fixed — `add_state` / `update_state` target path and empty-string handling

**Path bug (already fixed in current code):** Both tools now target `["state"]` instead of `[]`.
`add_state` creates the `state` object if missing before setting a key.

**Empty-string deletion (fixed 2026-06-19):** `mutateUpdateProperty` deletes when value is `""`
(`transact.ts:248`), which broke state defaults like `"title": ""`. Both `add_state` and
`update_state` now directly mutate `t.doc.document.state[key]` instead of calling
`mutateUpdateProperty`, so empty-string defaults are preserved.

**System prompt updated:** Tool descriptions changed from "at the document root" to
"under the document's `state` object".

### 14.2 🟡 Should-fix — deviations from recorded requirements

- **Persistence is not project-scoped.** `document-assistant.js` uses a single global key
  `"jx-ai-chat-history"`. §11.5 / plan step 19 require keying by **project root** — otherwise
  switching projects mixes conversations. Fix: append the project root to the key.
- **Context budget is a hardcoded `MAX_TOKENS = 8000`.** For a 128k model (gpt-4o) this truncates
  history far too early, and the §13 premium-component workstream produces large outputs that will
  hit it. Requirement was ~80% of the **model's** window. Also missing: the 50%-of-window _warning_
  threshold (currently `contextWarning` only fires on actual trimming, not as an early heads-up).

### 14.3 🟡 Gaps

- **Thin test coverage on the new surface.** Only the reactivity fix has a test. No tests for
  `set_style` / `add_state` / `move_node` / `create_*`, context trimming, or persistence — a test on
  `add_state` would have caught §14.1. Add unit tests before treating §11.2/§11.4/§11.5 as done.
- **`create_component` / `create_page` overwrite silently** — no collision check on an existing path,
  and the created file isn't opened/registered in Studio. Acceptable for v1; note the overwrite risk.

### 14.4 Fix checklist

- [x] `add_state` / `update_state`: target `["state"]`, create `state` if missing, handle `""`/removal. (2026-06-19)
- [x] Project-scope the persistence localStorage key — `persistKey()` appends `workspace.projectRoot`.
- [x] Make the context budget model-aware — `contextWindowFor(model)` × 80%, plus a 50% warning
      threshold (verified: gpt-4 at ~5k/8192 tokens → `contextWarning` set, no trim).
- [x] Add unit tests — `packages/studio/tests/ai-tools.test.js` (11 tests: state path/empty-string/
      dup/remove/undo, set_style, move_node). All green.
- [ ] (Optional, deferred) collision check + open-on-create for `create_component` / `create_page`.

### 14.5 Additional bugs found during the fix pass (2026-06-19)

- **🔴 Build break (fixed).** `ai-system-prompt.js` wrapped `` `state` `` in literal backticks
  **inside the backtick template literal**, prematurely closing it — the module failed to build
  (would have broken the studio bundle / GA.3). Replaced with `'state'`. Verified: builds, prompt
  is 9955 chars.
- **🔴 null-removal unreachable (fixed).** `set_property` / `set_style` / `update_state` advertise
  "pass value: null to remove", but the registry's `validate` rejects `null` on **required** args
  (`tools.js:181`), so removal never reached `execute`. Dropped `value` from each tool's `required`
  so null/omitted now means remove.

### 14.6 Verification status (2026-06-19)

- **Tests:** `@jxsuite/ai` 24/24; new `ai-tools.test.js` 11/11; `ai-loop` + `jx-validate-smoke` 7/7.
  Full studio suite: my changes add 11 passing tests and introduce **zero** new failures.
- **Pre-existing, NOT caused by this work:** the studio suite has **21 failing tests at the committed
  baseline** (`workspace` rename/primitive + `stylebook` CSS-variable suites) — test-pollution/ordering,
  unrelated to AI. And `bun run lint` was already red on committed `packages/server/src/ai-api.js`
  (`capitalized-comments`). Both predate this feature and should be tracked separately. All AI feature
  files now lint clean.
